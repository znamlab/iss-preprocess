Detection mCherry cells
=======================

For rabies experiments, a separate step is needed to detect starter cells which are
usually labelled by the nuclear mCherry native fluorescence. The first step is to detect
mCherry cells, which is preprocessing and is described here. The second step, to assign
which of these mCherry cells have enough rolonies to be considered rabies positive is
already science and out of the scope of `iss-preprocess` (but see `iss-analysis`).
